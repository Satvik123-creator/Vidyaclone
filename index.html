            Nikhil Rajput from VidyaGyan Gets admission as an Electrical enggineering student in
            the National Institute Of Technology-Hamirpur
          </h2>
          <p>
            When Nikhil Rajput dreamt of joining the top Engineering college, no one from
            his village of bareilly district in Uttar Pradesh had yet become an
            IITian. Son of a marginal farmer, Nikhilâ€™s goal seemed like a
            distant dream. However, destiny had bigger plans for him as he
            secured admission at VidyaGyan in 2010.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like every student at VidyaGyan, he was encouraged to contribute to
            the betterment of the society through various projects and this
            further helped in keeping alive his dream. Through his seven years at the School, he was nurtured and
            supported by his teachers to pursue his dream and excel in all
            fields. He scored 93.6 percent in Grade 12 exams and qualified JEE
            mains; however, chose to attempt to qualify the rigorous selection
            process of the National Defense Academy (NDA) and was successful
            when he cleared the written but unfrtunately couldn't clear the Service Selection Board
            interview.
          </p>
          <p>
            His teachers mentored and trained him throughout his journey. He was
            prepared for the written examinations and resources were arranged
            for his coaching for the SSB interview by VidyaGyan. He credits his
            teachers for instilling the values of integrity and hard work in
            him.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Nikhil looks forward to serving the country and motivate individuals
            like him to pursue their dreams and become achievers in the field of
            their choosing.
